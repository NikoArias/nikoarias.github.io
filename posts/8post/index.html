The second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th were characterized by the discovery and introduction of electricity in modern societies. Those were the times of Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, and Nikola Tesla. Electricity was the new fad, but for various reasons the fad did not thrive in the auto industry.</p><p>The first automobile with an internal combustion engine was invented in 1807 by François Isaac de Rivaz, but it was not until 1886 that the German engineer Karl Benz perfected it enough to be useful and for everyday use. However, the key to understanding why the internal combustion engine triumphed lies in the United States, where in 1903 Henry Ford founded the company that at that time was a revolution: Ford Motor Company. In those days the automobile market was equally divided, so that electric cars accounted for 38%, steam cars for 40% and gasoline cars for 22%. In 1907 Ford released the Model T with which it conquered the market, whose distinctive attribute was scalability.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f0wf1WPu7JU?autoplay=1" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>The main difficulties that electric cars already presented in those days can be summarized in 3 points:</p><p><img src=https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_09/209736/140225-tesla-musk-consumer-reports-mms-1426_060ff3ca9ea6b562159c55478543ccdb.fit-760w.jpg alt="Elon Musk"></p><p>Scope. A main disadvantage compared to the combustion engine alternative, which can be recharged as easily as by refilling the tank. In contrast, traditional batteries have long charging times. It should be added that the electricity grid at the beginning of the century was not as extensive as it is now.
Driving. The first electric cars were more like golf carts than any car we can see on the road now. As a result, there was a legitimate concern as to whether it was reliable and safe to take long journeys with a toy-like car.
Price. A basic problem with any instrument that uses batteries is the high cost they have. In the case of cars, it represents a very significant proportion of the price of the vehicle.</p><p>During the last century, the automotive industry has undergone very little change if we relativize it to what societies have come to change and the great technological transformation that we have experienced. On the contrary, cars continue to work with internal combustion engines based on the principle of transforming energy from the gasoline explosion in a controlled way in the cylinders to kinetic through axles that transmit this energy to the wheels to propel the vehicle in the direction desired. In this sense, the advances that the sector has undergone have focused more on perfecting the engine, evolving the vehicle in terms of safety and performance and, recently, optimizing and reducing the consumption of raw materials, that is, minimizing the use of fuel. fossil. In short, the downsides of electric vehicles remain the same as a century ago. There have been advances (some of them very positive, such as the use of seat belts by Volvo), but the technology base remains the same. Few sectors have been so stagnant for such long periods. To a large extent, this can be explained by the peculiarities of the sector, which we can summarize in 2 points.</p><p><img src=https://hips.hearstapps.com/roa.h-cdn.co/assets/16/13/1459487172-t3.jpg alt="Elon Musk"></p><p>High barriers to entry. The magnitude of this obstruction to the entry of new companies can be seen in the fact that in the United States since 1925 no new company has been consolidated in the sector, with Chrysler being the newest player. Setting up a vehicle production company requires a very high start-up capital. Let&rsquo;s think that before the product reaches the store, years of research, design and construction of the production plant have been necessary. A car is too expensive to be able to survive by selling few units at the same time that the company makes money, since the costs to be distributed on each unit would be astronomical. The alternative is to produce many units and this requires large production facilities (in fact this was the great asset that the Ford Model T exploited).
The sector does not assume internally the negative costs that its activity entails. The use of vehicles whose energy source is fossil fuels results in the emission of polluting particles. If the producing companies were to bear the costs of these emissions, they would be encouraged to produce less polluting vehicles as this would save costs. For reasons that are far from the reason of the article, companies do not assume these costs so that the only reason why production companies may be inclined to invest resources in making cars less polluting is the price of crude oil, which can lead to the decision of consumer purchases, and buyers&rsquo; demand for green cars, either because they are aware of climate change, want to save on fuel, etc.</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fnikoarias.github.io%2fposts%2f8post%2f&text=Tesla%2c%20the%20new%20Era%20cars.&via=" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fnikoarias.github.io%2fposts%2f8post%2f" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fnikoarias.github.io%2fposts%2f8post%2f&title=Tesla%2c%20the%20new%20Era%20cars." target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3a%2f%2fnikoarias.github.io%2fposts%2f8post%2f&title=Tesla%2c%20the%20new%20Era%20cars." target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fnikoarias.github.io%2fposts%2f8post%2f&title=Tesla%2c%20the%20new%20Era%20cars." target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3a%2f%2fnikoarias.github.io%2fposts%2f8post%2f&description=Tesla%2c%20the%20new%20Era%20cars." target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=next><a href=https://nikoarias.github.io/posts/my-first-post/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="E-sports as a measure of mass entertainment">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href=mailto:190563@llinstitute.com title="Email me"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fas fa-envelope fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/Niko%20Arias title=LinkedIn><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fab fa-linkedin fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fas fa-rss fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li></ul><p class="credits copyright text-muted"><a href=yourwebsite.com>Nicolas Arias</a>
